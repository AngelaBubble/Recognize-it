## Summary
 Our project is to build an application based on Android platform. :bowtie:
 
 This app is for people like students to detect handwritten characters by simply taking a picture or chosing photos from album. Then we convert handwritten characters to editable text or pdf file so that we are able to edit it or share it with others. :smirk::smirk::smirk:
 
 Also, since not everyone has proficiency of English, we can provide a function of translation. So that after detecting characters, we translate the sentences or passages to specific language, which means users can understand the context better. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes::stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes::stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
